## Overview:

### Emergency Resource Management System (ERMS)
Build an information management tool that supports government agencies and municipalities in locating and activating resources after an emergency such as a natural disaster, hazardous material spill, etc. The system is used because such events require resources above and beyond the set of resources that would normally meet a municipality's typical operational needs. Users of the system can:

1. **Add a Resource** Allows the user to add resources that will be available for use in case of a nearby emergency incident. Other users in the system will be able to search for and request these resources. 
2. **Add an Incident** The user selects this option in order to add some basic information about an emergency incident that has just occurred. 
3. **Search for Resources** This option allows the user to search for and request available resources in the case of an emergency. 
4. **Resource Status** This option allows the user to view currently deployed resources and manage resource requests that she has sent or received. 
5. **Resource Report** This option shows a summary report of all the user's resources grouped by their primary Emergency Support Function.
